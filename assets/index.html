                <p> I'm a Santa Clara University graduate with a B.A. in Film and a minor in Perfoming Arts
                    that has somehow ended up fascinated by technology and computer science.
                    Post-graduation adulting has been a whirlwind of growth and challenges.
                    I moved out of my mother's house and landed my first job at a Mexican Grill restaurant.
                    My mom wasn't too happy about that even though I hooked her up with delicious shrimp tacos.
                    At 22, I landed a job at a trucking company where I negotiated rates with import/export clients
                    and
                    made bonuses off of the marginal profits.
                    All this without a background in finance or accounting. So what happened with my film degree?
                    After a year there, I began working for a subtitling company called SDI
                    (Subtilting and Dubbing International.) That was my foot in the door! I met people from all
                    over
                    the world. I learned how to create subtitle files from scratch, how to edit and sync them to
                    different video frame rates and finally dove into the industry I wanted to be in. This helped
                    me
                    land a 3-month gig at Netflix, which then got extended to 4 months, 6 months, 8, and finally 12
                    months.
                    (Yes, I'm that good. Hire me? :P) Then, they let me go. It was a tough breakup. I wanted to get
                    married (be full-time, not a contactor), they just wanted to be friends with benefits at the
                    time (cool benefits by the
                    way.)
                    So now what? You live and you learn and you grow! I started looking into machine-assisted
                    translation,
                    localization engineering, computational linguistics, and although I'm not sure how I'm going to
                    get into these roles,
                    I knew I had to take this course. So here I am, excited to see where I'll be towards the end of
                    2019.
